1.	Question#1 from General Scripting and Exercise#3 from Mobile Automation has been completed.

2.	For Mobile Automation, an open source app called Flipkart has been used.  
Since the app is open source, it may not behave as expected due to the poor app development.
My script is not responsible for the poor app behavior of this application.

3.	Mobile Automation exercise has been completed assuming the client may already have required 
setting to launch and execute the scripts on test Android device.  Following are the instructions-

	1)	Download and Install JDK
	2)	Download and install Android SDK
	3)	Download and Install Maven
	4)	Download and Install Appium
	5)	Download and Install Android Emulator 
	6)	Proper configuration of Environment Variable under ~bash_profile
	
4)	Test Mobile App apk file is also included under the same project.

5)	Only 1 Github repo project is created and both General scripting and Mobile Automation exercise, including 
the Android apk file etc. everything is included under the same project in Github.

6)	Please feel free to reach out for any further details regarding instruction, execution etc.


Thank You,
